React Hooks and Their Uses

This project leverages React Hooks to manage state, side effects, and component lifecycle effectively.
1. useState

Manages local state within components. Commonly used for toggling UI elements, storing user inputs, or managing component states.

    Example: Toggling the FAQ answers open and close.

    const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(null);

    const toggleFAQ = (index) => {
      setActiveIndex(activeIndex === index ? null : index);
    };

2. useEffect

Handles side effects like fetching data or updating the DOM after render.

    Example: Could be used for analytics tracking or dynamically fetching FAQs from an API.

    useEffect(() => {
      console.log("Component mounted or updated");
    }, []);

3. useContext

Provides a way to pass data like theme or user authentication through the component tree without prop drilling.

    Use Case: Share authentication status or user preferences between components.

4. useRef

Accesses DOM elements or stores mutable values that donâ€™t trigger re-renders.

    Use Case: Could be used to manage focus on input fields in forms.

5. useNavigate (React Router Hook)

Handles programmatic navigation between pages.

    Use Case: Navigate users to service details or other pages.
